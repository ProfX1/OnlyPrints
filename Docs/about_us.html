		<h1>Meet Xavier, our 3D Printing Extraordinaire and Master of the Filament Arts!</h1>
		<img src="../Images/xavier.jpg" class="easteregg" alt="Xavier">
		<!--<img src="../Images/Snowden1.jpg"id="easteregg" alt="Snowden">-->
		<p>With a passion for all things three-dimensional, Xavier is not just a cybersecurity student; they're the conductor of the 3D printing symphony.
		Ever met someone who dreams in layers and thinks in polygons? Well, that's Xavier. They don't just manage commissions; they turn them into 3D-printed masterpieces that defy expectations. Their workspace is a fusion of creativity and precision, where plastic filaments meet boundless imagination.
		As a true enthusiast, Xavier thrives on the challenge of bringing ideas to life. Whether it's a custom prototype for a budding inventor or a whimsical design for an art project, they approach each commission with the zeal of a 3D-printing maestro.
		Known for their attention to detail and a knack for transforming visions into tangible reality, Xavier has turned the office into a hub of innovation and excitement. They've mastered the delicate dance between different printing materials, honed their skills in design optimization, and, rumor has it, can troubleshoot a misbehaving printer with a simple wave of their filament wand.
		But Xavier isn't all business. When they're not overseeing a print, they're probably immersed in the latest advancements in 3D printing technology, discussing the coolest filaments over a cup of hot chocolate, or passionately explaining the intricacies of layer resolution to anyone who will listen.
		In a world where 3D printing meets passion, Xavier stands at the helm, turning ordinary commissions into extraordinary creations. So, if you're looking for someone to breathe life into your ideas, someone whose love for 3D printing is contagious, Xavier is your go-to maestro, ready to conduct the symphony of your next 3D printing masterpiece.</p>
